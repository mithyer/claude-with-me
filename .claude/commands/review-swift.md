description: Review Swift code for iOS best practices
---

Please review the Swift code in the current context or selected files for:

1. **Memory Management**: Check for retain cycles, use of `weak` and `unowned` references
2. **Thread Safety**: Verify proper use of `@MainActor`, async/await, and main thread dispatching
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error propagation and handling
4. **Force Unwraps**: Identify any force unwraps (`!`) that could be risky
5. **Optionals**: Check for better optional handling patterns
6. **Naming Conventions**: Verify Swift naming conventions are followed
7. **Performance**: Look for potential performance issues
8. **Security**: Check for hardcoded secrets, insecure data storage
9. **Best Practices**: Verify alignment with modern Swift and iOS conventions

Provide specific line references and suggest improvements.
